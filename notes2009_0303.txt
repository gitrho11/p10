Yesterday:
  - Adam
  - Lars?
  - Vidal
  - Pierre (in at 8)

Lots of offices but they only rent 2

ok to park in back.

Met Vladimir (Vlad?).

Adam got me some possible work with aeroprise near 101 and shoreline:
  - Andrew Hogg 408 390 0686 , 1023 North Shoreline Boulevard suite 150, 94040 (Andrew not Andy)


They want to do a mobile remedy.

arch:
  - I do backend work.
  - Probably best to keep rhosync simple and put biz logic in another rails service
  - Vlad will do front-end

interview:
  - Met with Andrew and then CEO Dan Turchin
  - The project looks complex.  We will probably expand out rhosync and it needs to talk with remedy.
