  What is PhoneGap?
  phonegap.com
  PhoneGap is a development tool that allows web developers to take
  advantage of the core features in the iPhone, Android, and
  Blackberry SDK using JavaScript.


Adam gave a presentation to a bunch of android developers yesterday (at google?).

continue walking the wiki tutorial

then do the twitter tutorial

wiki:

git clone git://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes.git rhodes

cd rhodes/apps
rhogen app AccountApp

vi config.rb
vi index.erb

rhogen model Account "http://rhosyncdev.rhohub.com/sources/1" 1 name,industry

This will generate the following files in a directory called "Account":

controller.rb - contains the basic CRUD actions: index, new, create, edit, update and delete.

config.rb - provides the URL to connecting with the sync engine

index.erb - the HTML template to display the list of objects

new.erb - the template to supply values to create a new object

edit.erb - the template to edit an object

show.erb - displays the selected object

The source_url and source_id (parameters 3 and 4) refer to the rhosync source show url and id for the source, respectively.
Once this is generated you will probably want to go back and edit the index.html file for the app to have a link to the generated model. For example:
  <li><a href="Account">Accounts</a></li>

I was looking at this yesterday and noticed the calls to render.

Vlad had put them in.

In RoR, the render calls are not nec, they happen implicitly.

require 'rho/rhocontroller'

class AccountController < Rho::RhoController

  #GET /Account
  def index
    @Accounts = Account.find(:all)
    render
  end
...

here is the edit.erb:

<form title="Edit Account"
          class="panel"
          id="Account_edit_form"
          method="POST"
          action="<%=url_for(:action => :update)%>">
        <fieldset>
                <input type="hidden" name="id" value="<%=@Account.object%>"/>

                  <div class="row">
                          <label>Name: </label>
                          <input type="text" name="Account[name]" value="<%=@Account.name%>"/>
                  </div>

                  <div class="row">
                          <label>Industry: </label>
                          <input type="text" name="Account[industry]" value="<%=@Account.industry%>"/>
                  </div>

        </fieldset>
        <input type="submit" value="Update"/>
        <p align="center">
                <a href="<%=url_for(:action => :delete, :id => @Account.object)%>">
                        <font color="#990000">Delete</font>
                </a>
        </p>
</form>

I need to find an erb-mode for emacs.

Wiki:
  Testing Your Application on Devices

  http://wiki.rhomobile.com/index.php/Building_Rhodes_on_Supported_Platforms

Prerequisites
the iPhone SDK installed (as of February 1, 2009 it will require iPhone SDK 2.2.1)
the XCode IDE (highly recommended but not actually required)

What is the XCode IDE?

It's probably in here:
  /Developer/Applications/

wiki:
  Place your application code to rhodes/apps directory. You can change application folder: go to 'rhodes/shared/build' and open build.properties, uncomment and change apps.dir property
  I couldnt find 'rhodes/shared/build'
  ah, this is in the master branch not in 1-0-unstable branch
  I see this:
    rhodes/shared/build/build.properties:
      - #apps.dir=d:/projects/Apps
I dont get it, why the d: ?
Is this for doing bb development on a pc too?

wiki:
  XCode Build
  I did this:  apps.dir=/pt/c3/rho/rhodes/apps/BikleApp10

Lars:
  - master branch depends on ant
  - 1-0 will depend on rake

wiki Next:
  - Inside /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/iphone is an iPhone XCode project. Load that project (currently called Rhorunner but will be changed to Rhodes later) and do a build.
  - I see:

  /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/iphone:

  drwxr-xr-x   5 maco  staff    170 Mar  5 10:32 rhosynclib

  I think this is it: rhorunner.xcodeproj
  I clicked, it gives me an IDE type thing.
  - It has a code-highlighter editor which I can use to edit .rb files
  - Help is huge
  - I see evidence of a designer in there

How do I "do a build"
  - menu: Build
  - bottom: build succeeded 12 warnings
  - menu: build results (shows me warnings)
  - I just noticed a pull-down in the ide in upper lhc: Simulator 2.1 | debug

wiki:
  Inside the rhodes/apps directory is a file called "index.erb". Edit it and add your application to it.
  I thought I already edited this?

anyway, I put my change in:

wiki:
  After you change application code just run 'Build and Go' command in XCode (green-button-hammer)
  I did.  Now I see an iPhone!
  - Tip: after you make changes and want to see them reflected on the device, delete the file rhodes/iphone/build/debug-iphonesimulator, and rebuild.
  - I looked...

  /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/iphone/build:

  - it worked!

wiki:
  - Tip: to see a log of what is happening on the device, type command-shift-r in xcode to bring up the rhorunner console.
  - I found this in the ide-menu:  run-console, I see other things too like: debugger
  - search for: "something interesting here"

  - it worked!

So, that's the end of wiki-rhodes tutorial.

Now look at the twitter tutorial...

twitter:
  - look at the sample apps
  - I'll see if I can run them...
  - basecamp: I edited /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/apps/index.erb
  - edit     rhodes/shared/build/build.properties: apps.dir=/pt/c3/rho/rhodes/apps/Basecamp
  - rm -rf  /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/iphone/build/Debug-iphonesimulator
  - Inside /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/iphone is an iPhone XCode project. Load that project (currently called Rhorunner but will be changed to Rhodes later) and do a build.
  - I see a People link which does nothing..

  - try this one: GeoLocation
  - edit: /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/apps/index.erb ( I dont this page is getting used )
  - edit  /pt/c3/rho/rhodes/shared/build/build.properties: apps.dir=/pt/c3/rho/rhodes/apps/GeoLocation

  and

ooooooo

rhomsource status tells me if my sync failed
see ticket #350
http://rhomobile.lighthouseapp.com

Vlad has callback techniques for dealing with asynchronous events.

Vidal might be able to leverage off of this to deal with a request obtained asynchronously.

Vidal wants to be able to replace old page with new page if new page available.

He wants to avoid losing the old page if the sync fails.


oooooooooo

twitter demo:
  http://twitter.com/statuses/public_timeline.xml

  http://rubyonmobile.wordpress.com/2009/02/10/making-twitter-mobile-client-with-ruby-using-rhodes-rhosync-part-1/

Using Rhosync

Rhosync will let you define common CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) interfaces for mobile device via Rhodes.

Rhosync is built as a pure Ruby On Rails based application, so you should not have any problems if you know how to run and develop using Ruby On Rails.


After you install Rhosync following the instruction, let’s startup the
server, register your account, login to the server, and create an
application called “Twitter”. Once application is created, click “Add
Source” and create an source called “Twitter Public Timeline”

localhost:3000
register: dan/admin1
http://localhost:3000/apps/new
  name: twitter10
http://localhost:3000/apps/twitter12/edit
  add_source link

gives me:
  http://localhost:3000/apps/twitter12/sources/new

To setup adapter, you can either generate the adapter using “rhogen”
command, or type source code directly from the web form.

I choose generating adapter myself for better debugging purpose. If
your adapter code has some bugs, any exception will point the line
number which contains the bug. If you type code in the form, your code
is kept at database and get evaluated dynamically when required, but
exception only says your eval failed, which is harder to debug.

If you go for generating adapter, just type “PublicTimeline” at “Source Adapter Class”

Makoto:
  rhogen source PublicTimeline
  - do it from rhosync rails-root

query method

Here is my mimimalist code to fetch query from twitter.

def query
  uri = URI.parse(@source.url)
  res = Net::HTTP.start(uri.host, uri.port) {|http|
    http.get("/statuses/public_timeline.xml")
  }
  xml_data = XmlSimple.xml_in(res.body);
  @result = xml_data["status"]
end

How is (@source.url) getting filled?

I think I specify it via the form.

The form seems broken.

I'll start from twitter12

Form still broken.

I'll bounce the server.

still broken; the pull down lists nothing

I tried filling out the form anyway:

RuntimeError in SourcesController#create

darn.

check the group...

I'll wipe rhosync and do another git and start over.

I'll try the 1-0-unstable branch

I get same error!

Check that I'm on the right branch.

Lars:
  its a bug

Adam fixed it.

I need to get his fix.

I need to learn some more git...

I just did a clone ; I think he put the fix in master.

I see it:
